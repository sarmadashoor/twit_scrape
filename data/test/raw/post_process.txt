IMAGE #1:
1. Full-Stack Al Startups

Why sell Al tools when you can build an entire business around them? Think Al-powered law firms or clinics
that outpace traditional ones.

2. Designers as Founders

Designers, it's your time to shine! Use your eye for detail and user empathy to launch startups that people love
to use.

3. Voice Al Revolution

Tired of robotic phone menus? Create Al that handles customer calls so naturally, people won't know it's not
human.

4. Al in Scientific Research

Bring Al to the lab bench. Help scientists accelerate discoveries in chemistry, biology, and materials science
with smarter tools.

5. Al Personal Assistants

Turn to-do lists into done lists. Build Al that doesn't just remind you but actually completes tasks on your
behalf.

6. Al for Government Automation

Help governments save money and time by automating paperwork and processes with Al solutions.

7. Public Safety Tech

Develop tools like smart cameras and data systems that assist law enforcement in solving crimes more
efficiently.

8. Next-Gen Manufacturing

Reimagine factories with automation and robotics, making manufacturing faster, cheaper, and closer to home.
9. Stablecoin Infrastructure

Build the backend systems that enable businesses and banks to use digital currencies seamlessly

10. LLMs for Chip Design

Use Al to design better, more efficient computer chips, speeding up innovation in hardware.

11. Al-First Fintech

Create financial tools powered by Al that offer smarter budgeting, investing, and lending solutions.

12. Space Infrastructure Startups

As space becomes more accessible, develop the logistics and support systems that make satellite launches
routine.

13. Al-Aided Engineering Tools

Design intuitive engineering software that leverages Al to simplify complex tasks for professionals.

14. Empowering Non-Al Jobs

Focus on building tools that enhance jobs Al can't replace, supporting roles that require a human touch.

1/ Alisn't just a tool, it's the business.

YC is pushing for "full-stack Al companies." Instead of selling Al tools to industries like law or healthcare,
they're encouraging founders to build entire Al-driven firms that compete directly with traditional players. (Y

2/ Designers, it's your time to shine.

With coding becoming more accessible, YC believes designers should lead startups. Their user-centric
approach and aesthetic sense are crucial in creating products people love.

3/ Voice Al is the new frontier.

Phone interactions haven't changed in decades. YC sees a massive opportunity in developing voice Al that can
handle customer service calls, making interactions seamless and human-like.
4/ Revolutionizing scientific research with Al.

Many scientific tools are outdated. YC is looking for startups that apply Al to accelerate discoveries in fields
like chemistry and materials science.

5/ From to-do lists to done lists.

The dream of a true Al personal assistant is closer than ever. YC wants startups to create Al that doesn't just
organize tasks but completes them, learning from your habits and preferences.

6/ Fixing healthcare‚Äôs administrative bloat.

A significant chunk of healthcare costs stem from administrative tasks. YC is interested in Al solutions that can
automate data extraction and entry, streamlining operations.

7/ Personalized Al tutors for all.

Education hasn't changed much, but Al offers a chance to create personalized learning experiences. YC is
keen on startups that can make learning more interactive and tailored.

8/ Robotics‚Äô ChatGPT moment is near.

Robots have been limited by perception and judgment. With advancements in Al, YC sees potential in
developing software tools that make robots more adaptable and useful in various industries.

9/ Reimagining home security with Al.

Home security systems are ripe for innovation. YC is looking for startups that use Al to enhance safety, making
systems more proactive and intelligent.

10/ Empowering employees with internal Al agents.

Imagine every employee having their own Al assistant to handle repetitive tasks. YC is interested in
infrastructure that allows for the creation of these internal agents.

11/ Building the next OpenAl.

YC was an early backer of OpenAl and wants to fund more independent Al research labs. They're open to
supporting long-term, open-ended research projects.

12/ Voice-controlled email management.

Managing emails can be tedious. YC envisions voice assistants that can help users triage emails, draft replies,
and manage schedules, all through voice commands.

Hey team,
I've always believed in radical candor and despise
those who sugar-coat reality to avoid stating the
unpleasant truth. The very basis for radical candor is
care. You care enough about your friends and
colleagues to tell them the truth because you want
them to be able to understand it, grow, and succeed.
So here is the unpleasant truth: Al is coming for your
jobs. Heck, it's coming for my job too. This is a wake-
up call.
It does not matter if you are a programmer, designer,
product manager, data scientist, lawyer, customer
support rep, salesperson, or a finance person - Al is
coming for you.
You must understand that what was once considered
‚Äòeasy tasks‚Äô will no longer exist; what was considered
‚Äòhard tasks‚Äô will be the new easy, and what was
considered ‚Äòimpossible tasks‚Äô will be the new hard. If
you do not become an exceptional talent at what you
do, a master, you will face the need for a career
change in a matter of months. | am not trying to scare
you. | am not talking about your job at Fiverr. | am
talking about your ability to stay in your profession in
the industry.

What | am doing with ai write now to build a saas in weekend.

1. First, gotta come up with something to build.

2.1 get Gemini to do some deep dives on who else is doing similar stuff. Gotta know the competition,
right?

3. | check out what those competitors are offering and what makes them tick. Helps figure out my
angle.

4. Then | hit up Claude with my idea and the basics. | make it grill me with like 20 questions to see if the
idea even holds water.

5. If it survives the interrogation, | tell Claude to write up a super basic one-page plan (PRD).

6. Boom, now I've got a simple outline.

7. Back to Claude, but this time we're just talking looks. | get it to break the whole thing into small,
shippable chunks, focusing only on the Ul. For each chunk, it tells me what each page will show, what
you can do on it, and even draws little user flow diagrams. It's surprisingly fast.

8. | check Claude's work, make any tweaks, and then get it to turn each Ul chunk into a prompt for
v0.dev.

9. Then | take those prompts over to v0.dev and start generating the Ul piece by piece, tweaking the
prompts as | go until it looks right.

10. Once the whole Ul is done in v0.dev, | download the code.

11. | get Claude to write a simple README file that explains what we're building. Then | use Cursor or VS
Code Copilot to start adding the database, backend logic, and all the stuff that makes it actually
work.

12. And that's pretty much how | go from a random idea to a (hopefully) working SaaS product.

It's kinda crazy how much Al helps speed things up these days!"

Vibe Coding Isn't Dumb - You're Just Doing It Wrong
(practical guide fo shiping apps with AL minimal pain)
Vive coding gets aot of hate, especialy from ‚Äúserious‚Äù devs. But the truth is: ot every project needs to be
Scalable, secure, or architected ike is going public on the stock market
Most of the ime, you just want 9 turn your de nto working app - fast, Hore's how to doit without driving
yourself insane. These arent fancy tricks, just things that work.
1. Pick a mainstream tech stack (zero effort, high reward)
1 you'te building a basic website, Just use Wis, Framer, lackEoxal or any other site builder You don't need to
code it from scratch
1#you need a ea web app:
> Use Nextis + Supabase.
Yes, Sve s col, Vue i nic, but non of that matters when you're trying to get something done. Next wins
because thas the largest user base, the most examples online, and Ais most oly t got ight. f your
backend needs rel logic, add Python
youre thinking about building a game:
Learn Unity or Unreal
Trying 1 vibe-cods a game in JavaScript is usually a dead end. Nobody's plying your Thre s experiment, Ba
honest about what you're building.
4 Skip his rule and youl burn day fixing th same bugs that Al could ve solved in seconds  f only youd
picked the stack it knows best
2. Write a simple PRD (medium effort, high reward)
You dort need a fancy spec doc. Just write Product Requirement Document tht does wo things:

+ Forces you to clarity what you actualy want.

+ Breaks the ork nto smal clear steps.
Think oft ke hieing 3 contractor, ou cart write down what ‚Äúdone‚Äù oaks ke or Day 1or Week 1, your Al vant
know either
Once you've got the plan, give the Al one step at a time. Kot ‚Äúdo everything at once‚Äù
Example:
Chat:
‚Äúleplenent Step 1.1: Add Feature A"
Testi. Fixit. Then:
New Chat:
‚ÄúIeplenent Step 2: Add Feature 8¬∞
Bugs compound over time, so fixing them early saves you from a mss ter.
3. Use version control (low effort, high reward)
Avil eventually break your code. Period.
Youneed a way to rol back. Most ools have automatic checkpaints, but i's beter to usa Git Manual commits
force you to actualy track progress, so when Al makes a mess, youl know exactly where to revert.
4. Provide working code samples (medium effort, high reward)
Don't assume Al wil get third-party varies or APs right just from docs.
Before you tart building a full feature, write small working sept that does the core thing (e.g. pull 10.Jra
Hikets). Once t works, ave, and when you start the real ask, pas back nto your Al prompts as a reference
his mall step wil save yo from wasting hours on tiny mismatches (wrong AP! version, bad assumptions,
‚Äòmissing auth headers, etc.).
5. When stuck, start a new chat with better info (low effort, high reward)
The "copy eror past to chat fx > new errr repeat‚Äù cycles a rap
When you hit tis loop, sop. Open fresh chat and tll the A

+ Whats broken.

+ What you expected to happen.

+ What you've already tied

+ Include logs, errors, screenshots.
The longer your chat istory gets, the dumber the Al gets. A clan context an clear input often saves what

CONTENT: OpenAI published their official GPT-4.1 prompting guide, and I summarized it into these 13 practical tips to help you get the most out of the new model. https://t.co/8pOvNriK22

IMAGE #1:
1. Follow instructions literally. GPT-4.1is trained to follow directions more precisely than previous models.
Be explicit about what you want.
2. Place instructions strategically. For long context, put critical instructions at both the beginning AND end
of your prompt for best results.
3. Use specific delimiters. Markdown headings, XML tags, and backticks help the model understand
structure. JSON performs poorly for document collections.
4. Induce planning with prompting. Ask the model to "think step by step" when solving complex problems
to significantly improve accuracy.
5. Design agentic workflows with clear reminders:
o "Keep going until the problem is completely resolved"
o "Use tools when uncertain instead of guessing"
o "Plan extensively before each action"
6. Leverage the 1M token context window wisely. Performance stays strong up to the limit, but degrades
when retrieving many items or reasoning across the entire context.
7. Balance internal vs. external knowledge. For factual queries, instruct the model to "only use provided
context" or "combine context with basic knowledge" based on your needs.
8. Format your prompts with clear sections:
o Role and Objective
o Instructions (with subcategories)
o Reasoning Steps
o Output Format
o Examples
o Final instructions
9. Guide information retrieval. When working with documents, ask the model to first analyze which ones
are relevant before attempting to answer.
10. Avoid rare prompt patterns. The model may struggle with extremely repetitive outputs or parallel tool
calls. Test these cases carefully.
11. Be direct with corrections. If model behavior is unexpected, a single clear sentence is usually enough
to steer it in the right direction.
12. Use specific frameworks for coding. For generating code changes, use the V4A diff format with context
lines for maximum accuracy.
13. Remember it's not a reasoning model. GPT-4.1 doesn't automatically provide an internal chain of
thought, but you can explicitly request it to show its work.

But brand is the batter. It‚Äôs not decoration, it‚Äôs the foundation. It shows up in how you talk to customers, how your product feels, how your team makes decisions.

Clearest Path to getting the most out of LLMs using prompts according to Google

1. Understand the tool. A prompt is how you talk to a language model. The better the input,
the better the output.

2. You don‚Äôt need to be a coder. Anyone can write prompts. But great prompting? That's a
skill.

3. Choose your model wisely. Gemini, GPT-4, Claude, they all have strengths. Know what
you're working with.

4. Zero-shot prompt = ask without examples.
Few-shot = show examples first.
Chain-of-thought = force it to ‚Äúthink‚Äù step by step.
Use the right weapon for the job.

5. You can control the vibe. Tweak the temperature (creativity), top-p, max tokens, and
more to steer the output.

6. Be specific. Tell it exactly what you want. Vagueness kills good output.

7. Context is king. Add details, background, and constraints. Think of it like briefing a
world-class assistant.

8. Iterate like crazy. Good prompts aren‚Äôt written, they‚Äôre rewritten.

9. Give examples. Want a specific tone, format, or structure? Show it.

10. Build multi-turn prompts. Ask, follow-up, dig deeper. Treat the model like a convo, not a
vending machine.

11. Avoid traps:
‚Äî Too vague = bad output
‚Äî Too long = confusion
‚Äî Too complex = model gets lost
‚Äî Biased wording = biased results

12. Prompts aren‚Äôt one-size-fits-all. Customize by task: writing, summarizing, coding,
customer support, etc.

13. Prompt engineering isn‚Äôt optional. It's how you unlock superpowers with Al.

You know you've made it when someone copies what you built, and you feel nothing.

No outrage. No need to tweet about it. Maybe just a quiet "that's cool" in your head.

Because by the time people start tracing your work, you've already moved on from it.
