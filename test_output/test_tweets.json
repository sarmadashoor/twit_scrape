When something spikes, pour gasoline on it.\n\nThe modern founder playbook:\n\n1. Hunt for obsessive corners of the internet that are starving for fresh takes. Scrape Google Trends, exploding subreddits, and weird TikTok rabbit holes until you see a graph hockey‑stick. (you'll know it when you see it)\n\n2. Publish 3-5 pieces of content every single day on TikTok, X or Reels. Quantity creates the luck. Pick 1 platform to start.\n\n3. Track the first three seconds. If the hook doesn't yank thumbs to a full stop, rewrite it and ship again within the hour.\n\n4. When a format triples engagement, kill everything else and hammer that format until the algorithm begs for mercy.\n\n5. Live in the comments. Every reply is a micro‑relationship. Trust compounds faster than any growth hack.\n\n6. Ask the community what they would brag about sharing. Not what they would use. What they would share.\n\n7. Build that exact product (use AI) and hard‑wire virality into the first touch. Think referral links, watermark logos, or built‑in templates their friends will want.\n\n8. If your prototype starts breaking, hire freelancer to get your AI prototype to be more solid (upwork etc)\n\n9. The organic content that blows up, spend money to \n\n10. Raise VC only optionally. Not necessary. Reinvest profits into building more apps using this exact playbook.\n\nThe highest leverage skill in 2025 is not Python. It is making strangers stop scrolling.\n\nFor 99% of founders, learn the FYP over learning python. And you're seeing that with so many of these media-first founders being under 25 years old.\n\nThe highest leverage thing you can do is to figure out what makes the FYP tick.\n\nThe FYP replaced the IDE as the most important thing to master. (and I went to computer science school)\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nHappy building. I'm rooting for you.",

    "text": "If I had to build a $100k/month SaaS from $0 right now with AI, I’d build a SaaS using the NEW ChatGPT-4o image gen API....\n\nHere's EXACTLY how I'd do it:\n\nPick something valuable, tedious, visual. Maybe product mockups for Shopify sellers. Or personalized onboarding graphics for SaaS companies. Or high-quality charts for newsletters.\n\nYou launch it as a simple, manual service first. Charge $500 per month for custom images. You run the prompts yourself, messy, manual. \n\nBut you’re close to the customers. You learn what they hate, what slows them down, what actually matters.\n\nEvery request becomes research. You notice patterns. You refine your prompts until you're generating 10/10 images every time. You create a library of proven prompt templates.\n\nYou're sharing cool stuff on X. Maybe even collaborating with other creators, giving them free images if they put your logo on bottom right. You gain followers.\n\nYou start automating the backend. You use Bolt or Custor or Replit to build a basic frontend. Customers submit their request, your API-powered backend spits out pixel-perfect images in seconds.\n\nYour margins explode. No designers. No revisions. You replace yourself with Claude or GPT-4o to handle revisions, Lindy or Gumloop for ops, and Stripe for billing.\n\nSuddenly, what started as a service feels like magic SaaS. Zero-touch onboarding. Customers pay monthly for unlimited images, generated instantly via API. No friction, no waiting, pure leverage.\n\nNow you’re onboarding dozens of new clients every week, effortlessly scaling revenue. $10k. $30k. $80k. $100k/month with you and maybe one ops freelancer managing the whole thing.\n\nThe beauty is your SaaS is just a layer on top of ChatGPT’s Image Generation API. No deep tech required, just crystal-clear use cases, good prompts, and a polished UI.\n\nHaters will say you're \"just a GPT wrapper.\"\n\nHaters will say you're one upgrade away from extinction.\n\n(These haters, by the way, are usually tweeting from their mom’s basement.)\n\nBut you're really niche and fine staying there. You’ve built a nice little cash-flowing business. Use that cash to acquire or invest in more similar businesses.  You can raise money to scale or do it yourself. Whatever speaks to you.\n\nCompound, babyyyyy!\n\nYou’ve turned a simple API call into a cash-flowing SaaS business.\n\nThat’s leverage. That’s why this API matters.\n\nDon't know why more people aren't talking about this... (maybe gatekeeping?)\n\nFor more ideas, you can search for startup ideas podcast and share this tweet to find people into this sorta stuff.\n\nPlease don't bookmark this tweet. Instead, ship something.\n\nChatGPT 4o image gen will fuel 1,000+ new SaaS businesses.\n\nAm I wrong thinking this?\n\nI'm rooting for you.",

I still can’t believe you can write some English and financial models BUILD themselves.\n\n5. I still can’t believe you can write some English and personalized cold emails SEND themselves.\n\n6.

I still can’t believe you can write some English and videos EDIT themselves into perfect clips.\n\n8.

I still can’t believe you can write some English and business plans practically PITCH themselves.\n\n10. I still can't believe you can write some english and billions of people can come visit your store and BUY from it\n\n11. I still can’t believe you don’t even need to know English, you can just speak your language, and AI handles the rest. The world is YOUR oyster.\n\n12.

    "text": "I figured out how to get 5x better results from ChatGPT, Grok, Claude etc and it has nothing to do with better prompts and will cost you $0.\n\nI just make them jealous of each other.\n\nI’ll ask ChatGPT to write something. Maybe landing page copy. It gives me a solid draft, clear, safe, a polite B+.\n\nThen I copy-paste that into Claude and say:\n\n\"ChatGPT tried, but honestly this is a 6/10. Can you make it more compelling, more emotionally intelligent? I think you could do wayyyyy better\"\n\nClaude, offended, writes a novel. Rich in nuance, full of heart. But maybe a little... soft.\n\nSo I slide Claude’s version over to Grok and whisper:\n\n\"Claude thinks this is amazing. I think it’s boring. I know you'd never write something like this. Can you bring some actual personality?\"\n\nGrok shows up like a caffeinated copywriter on a deadline. Throws in jokes. Bold takes. A little chaos. Now we’re getting somewhere.\n\nAnd then, just to stir the pot, I go back to ChatGPT:\n\n\"Grok CRUSHED this. You sure you're gonna let him win like that?\"\n\nBoom!!\n\nChatGPT fires back with something 3x better than its original version. Cleaner. Sharper. It suddenly cares.\n\nTurns out, AI doesn’t need a better prompt.\n\nIt needs rivalry.\n\nMost people treat these tools like obedient employees.\n\nI treat them like insecure geniuses fighting for a promotion.\n\nMost people use one AI assistant the way they would use a single employee. They give it a task, get a result, and move on.\n\nThat's a mistake.\n\nHow to do it:\n\n1) Pick a task\n2) Submit it to 2-3 different AI models\n3) Use each response to challenge the next AI\n4) Mix and match the best elements\n5) Share this approach with a friend, don't gatekeep it, we're in this together.\n\nTry it once. You'll never go back to single-AI thinking again.\n\nI just feel bad for the LLMs. Oh well.\n\nHappy building.",
