When something spikes, pour gasoline on it.\n\nThe modern founder playbook:\n\n1. Hunt for obsessive corners of the internet that are starving for fresh takes. Scrape Google Trends, exploding subreddits, and weird TikTok rabbit holes until you see a graph hockey‑stick. (you'll know it when you see it)\n\n2. Publish 3-5 pieces of content every single day on TikTok, X or Reels. Quantity creates the luck. Pick 1 platform to start.\n\n3. Track the first three seconds. If the hook doesn't yank thumbs to a full stop, rewrite it and ship again within the hour.\n\n4. When a format triples engagement, kill everything else and hammer that format until the algorithm begs for mercy.\n\n5. Live in the comments. Every reply is a micro‑relationship. Trust compounds faster than any growth hack.\n\n6. Ask the community what they would brag about sharing. Not what they would use. What they would share.\n\n7. Build that exact product (use AI) and hard‑wire virality into the first touch. Think referral links, watermark logos, or built‑in templates their friends will want.\n\n8. If your prototype starts breaking, hire freelancer to get your AI prototype to be more solid (upwork etc)\n\n9. The organic content that blows up, spend money to \n\n10. Raise VC only optionally. Not necessary. Reinvest profits into building more apps using this exact playbook.\n\nThe highest leverage skill in 2025 is not Python. It is making strangers stop scrolling.\n\nFor 99% of founders, learn the FYP over learning python. And you're seeing that with so many of these media-first founders being under 25 years old.\n\nThe highest leverage thing you can do is to figure out what makes the FYP tick.\n\nThe FYP replaced the IDE as the most important thing to master. (and I went to computer science school)\n\nAm I wrong?\n\nHappy building. I'm rooting for you.",
